#Write a Python program to create a dictionary of keys
# x, y, and z where each key has as value a list from 11-20, 21-30, and 31-40 respectively.
# Donâ€™t use static value for 11-20, 21-30, 31-40. Access the fifth value of each key from the dictionary.

dic2 = [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]
dic3 = [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39]
print('first')
print(dic1)
print(dic2)
print(dic3)
